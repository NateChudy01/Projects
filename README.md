# Nate Chudy Project List
### In this GitHub repository you can see different projects that I have created. They demonstrate many different skills such as java, python, SQL, and others. Below is a list of the projects and a breif descrption of what each of them do:
## Projects:

### Project 1: 
#### Hello World -
This project is creating a Hello World program in Java and it begins with a simple print statement. From there we begin to take different user inputs and incorporate them into our program. From prompted user inputs to command line arguments we are able to customize the basic hello world program with different aspects

### Project 2: 
#### Investment -
This projects purpose when creating it was to create an interest calculator. It is able to incorporate the inpputs from the user in the terminal but also if a .csv file is added in the correct format then it is able to process each line of the .csv file. You are able to calculate either the simple or the compound interest and it takes in parameters like the inital amount, two dates, interest type and rate. It uses these inputs to calculate the interest over that time period

### Project 3: 
#### MaristCampus -
This projects purpose was to create the Marist campus using object oriented programming. Creating the classes for the campus, buildings, rooms, classrooms, offices, courses, and employees was all necessary and when implemented the campus would be a web of all of these objects. The MaristCampus.java file was used as a testing java file, creating the objects to put in the campus we had to test every function and attribute in every class we created making sure the the setters and getters as well as the additional functions worked properly

### Project 4: 
#### ATM -
This projects purpose was to create an automatic banking system. This program simmulates the interface of an ATM allowing you to either load an account from the bank, or create an account to then be stored in the bank with its own unique ID number. This project tests the ability to make code user proof as well as link together different accounts and clients

### Project 5: 
#### Warehouse Management -
This projects purpose was to create a warehouse ordering system using the input from .csv files. There were two input files (orders.csv and products.csv) and this projects purpose was to take each of them in and create a pick list which is sorted by the bin, shelf, and aisle of the product as well as the warehouse it was ordered from and then orderID of that specific order. This project tests your ability to get information from a .csv file as well as how you are able to sort information and untilately display it to a user for them to benefit from
