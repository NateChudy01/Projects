# iStorage Description
### This project is not available to be ran due to the necessity for a connection to AWS. iStorage is a project that was created as a "copy" of iCloud. There is an iOS app that is on your phone where you upload pictures to it, then with a connection with an AWS Lambda function through and API Gateway connection, there is a .jar file that is executed to upload the image to AWS S3 storage that acts as the iCloud storage space. This file contains two files:

### - PhotoPicker.swift: In order to view this file it was necessary to attach the entire project, this means that it is necessary to go to the following directory in the current GitHub to see the .swift file for the front end iOS app, "iStorage/iStorage/iStorage/PhotoPicker.swift". This file is the front end for the app and the entire Xcode project is included here if you would like to download and run it on Xcode

### - StringHandler.java: This file is the .java file that is in the .jar file allowing for images to be passed to it and then uploaded to AWS S3 storage
