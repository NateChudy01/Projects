# iStorage Description
### This project is not available to be ran due to the necessity for a connection to AWS. iStorage is a project that was created as a "copy" of iCloud. There is an iOS app that is on your phone where you upload pictures to it, then with a connection with an AWS Lambda function through and API Gateway connection, there is a .jar file that is executed to upload the image to AWS S3 storage that acts as the iCloud storage space. This file contains two files:

### - PhotoPicker.swift: This file is the swift file that is executed on Xcode that runs on your phone to create the app on any iPhone homescreen

### - StringHandler.java: This file is the .java file that is in the .jar file allowing for images to be passed to it and then uploaded to AWS S3 storage
