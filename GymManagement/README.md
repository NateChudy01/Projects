# Run The Project
### Download all the .java files in this file as well as the .csv files. To run, you need to run the RFFC.java file which contains the interface for the gym management system in the terminal. The .csv files will be accessed by the project and used for the employee list, members list, and products that are sold in the gym concession stand.
